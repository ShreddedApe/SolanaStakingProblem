# SolanaStakingProblem
We changed the project staking system and now some NFTs won't load into the new website. Please help

Hello everyone,

I'm not a dev myself but our Solana NFT project is in trouble and we can't seem to fix it. Our first staking UI was really confusing and not well made so we hired a new dev and he made his own staking system. But now that people try to stake them into the new v2 site for some reason the NFTs just won't load. We found a work around for this and apparently if people send them to a complete new/other wallet with a different seed phrase it works. Some people that bought from ME do have this problem as well and they never staked into the v1 site. We think it's because the v1 is interfering with the v2 we can't tell for sure because of that. We already tried lots of things, updating java, clear cashe, revoke v1 in trusted apps, amigrating tokens, etc. We already got 70% staked into the v2. If anyone know how to fix this or what the problem could be, please reach out to me!
